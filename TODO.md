## API
- Change versioning structure to something that makes more sense. Perhaps have /api folder in root and children there.

## Deployment
- Containerise server and client with Docker

## Testing
- Start testing API routes
- Test prisma, authentication with JWT and middleware separately
- Look at DB mocking etc

## Good to have
