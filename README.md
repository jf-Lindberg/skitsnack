# Skitsnack forum
This is a hobby project of mine that is intended to become a fully functional web forum. Once it is finished, a real 
README will replace this one. 

## Current status
Users can register and login with proper authentication set up. They can publish, update and delete posts, comments 
and replies to comments. Before work on front-end begins, I want to increase the code coverage and add categories as 
well as a like function.
